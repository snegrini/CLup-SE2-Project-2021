\chapter{Acceptance Test Cases}
In this chapter we analysed the implemented requirements of the project and tested them.\newline 
By comparing the list of requirements presented in RASD and the ones inside the ITD we can conclude that only a few requirements where actually implemented.\newline
For instance, some requirements that we consider vital such as R4 and R12 are not implemented.

Moreover we noticed that in the second chapter of the ITD (Requirements and Functionalities Implemented) is stated that "\textit{The	management side is kept at a bare minimum providing only the store operator functions to call customer to the entrance, scan tickets and view real time data about the store crowdedness}". This is partially true because there is not the possibility to check the store crowdedness.

First thing we ran the unit and integration tests provided: all of them passes.\newline
Then we concentrated on testing the app in a real use case scenario, just like stated in the RASD. The majority of the test performed are listed below.

We noticed that there is a design flaw about the ticket call when the store is full. An operator can always call all the tickets in the queue without any check about the store capacity.\newline This results in the following bad behaviour:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The store reaches the maximum of his capacity with the scan of a ticket.
	\item The operator calls the next ticket or more.
	\item If the store remains full the scan of a ticket fails.
	\item Then, if no one exits the store in 5 minutes (expiration time of a called ticket) the called tickets expire and this results in the deletion of the ticket.
	\item The customer who owned the ticket need to get in queue again with a new one.
\end{enumerate}
