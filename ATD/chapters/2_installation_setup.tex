\chapter{Installation Instruction}
We followed the instructions given in the ITD. The group provided both the backend and frontend of their application already deployed.
Though we also built and tested the application by running the backend and frontend ourselves on our devices.\newline
To actually run the test code, a few, small adjustment were applied to the given instructions: for example the installation of some python dependencies.

The application was also run from the source code, no installation of the Flutter framework was necessary, as we already developed our project using Flutter. Steps followed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item clone the repository;
	\item import the project in Android Studio;
	\item build the project.
\end{itemize}
