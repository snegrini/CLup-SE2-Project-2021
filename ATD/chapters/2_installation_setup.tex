\chapter{Installation Instruction}
We followed the instructions given in the ITD. The group provided both the backend and frontend of their application already deployed.
Though we also built and tested the application by running the backend and frontend ourselves on our devices.

The application was also run from the source code, no installation of the Flutter framework was necessary, as we already developed our project using Flutter. Steps followed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item clone the repository;
	\item import the project in Android Studio;
	\item build the project.
\end{itemize}
