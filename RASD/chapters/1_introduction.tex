\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of the Customers Line-up (CLup).
It provides functional and nonfunctional requirements for the development of the system, including use cases, features, user interaction and system constraints.

This document is addressed to the developers who have to implement the requirements and could be used as an agreement between the customer and the contractors.

The ambition is that adoption of these requirements will avoid having crowds inside facilities and to lighten the consequent long lines forming outside. This matter is particularly relevant during a pandemic emergency, like the one that is going in the present day.
