\chapter{Testing}
The testing process has been divided into two type of testing: unit testing and integration testing. Below is shown a summary of the main tests performed.\newline
Due to time constraints, the testing phase was focused on the server side.\newline
No unit tests have been performed on the apps as they are thin clients and most of the logic lives inside the server.
