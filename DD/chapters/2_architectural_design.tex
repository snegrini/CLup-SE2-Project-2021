It is composed by a client part and a server part:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Server side:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Application Server (CLup Server):} server where all the logic is located. It communicates with other servers and is the central point of the system.
		\item \textit{Web Server:} server used for the communication with the clients.
		\item \textit{Database Server:} server where all data are stored.
		\item \textit{Mail Server:} server used to send confirmation emails about the bookings.
		\item \textit{External map API:} API used to retrieve data about the distance of the user from the store. This information will be used to inform the user of when leave the current place.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Client side:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Customer App:} application installed on customers smartphone. It allows to retrieve a ticket or book a visit.
		\item \textit{Store App:} application installed on employees smartphone. It allows to validate store passes.
		\item \textit{Ticketing Kiosk:} tablet installed at the entrance of the store to which a printer is attached. It has installed a modified version of the Customer App which is able to print the ticket on place. The application is bounded to the store it is installed at. It works exactly as a normal Customer App, it allows you to take tickets only for bounded store but not to make reservations.\newline
		This component will be omitted in the next sections because, for the functions it provides, it behaves just as a Customer App.
		\item \textit{Web Browser:} used by store employees and managers to access the web dashboard.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Component view}

\subsection{High Level}
The following component diagram highlights all the components of the system and describes both his internal and external interactions.
A general overview of the whole system is shown in \clupautoref{fig:cmp_high_level}. Further details will be provided in the subsequent diagrams.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[origin=c,width=\textwidth]{component/cmp_high_level}
	\caption{\textit{High level} component diagram.}
	\label{fig:cmp_high_level}
\end{figure}

The components in \clupautoref{fig:cmp_high_level} are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{CLup Server}: contains the business logic of the entire system. This component offers to both customers and supermarkets the features of \textit{CLup}. On the one side, the interfaces provided by this components allow the client side (mobile apps and web app) to communicate with the server. On the other side, it interfaces with external systems such as the database server, the email server and the maps service. Further detailed in \clupautoref{fig:cmp_clup_server}.
	
	\item \textbf{Customer App}: represents the mobile application installed on the customers' devices. Upon authentication via the \textbf{Token Interface}, it allows customers to access the store pass functions of \textit{CLup} by using the \textbf{StorePass Interface}. Periodically, it asks the server for information on store passes and distance from stores. In case of updates, for example a store pass is deleted or it's time to leave, it shows a notification to the user.
	
	\item \textbf{Store App}: represents the mobile application	installed on the devices of the store. Upon authentication with credentials via the \textbf{Token Interface}, it allows the store employees to access the scan functions of \textit{CLup} by using the \textbf{Scan Interface}.
	
	\item \textbf{Web App}: represents the web application reachable by any modern web browser by the store managers. Upon authentication with credentials via the \textbf{Auth Interface}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item allows the store managers to access the dashboard functions of \textit{CLup} by using the \textbf{Dashboard Interface};
		\item allows CLup admins to register and delete stores from the system by using the \textbf{Dashboard Interface}.
	\end{itemize}
	Furthermore, it offers to the customers the landing pages of both the \textit{confirmation} and \textit{deletion links} required by the booking process via the \textbf{Dashboard Interface}.
	
	\item \textbf{Database Server}:	provides the interface to the \textit{CLup Server} to deal with the data management process. 
	
	\item \textbf{Mail Server}: provides the interface to the \textit{CLup Server} to deal with the email sending and receiving services needed. The email system is necessary for both the process of registration of stores and the validation of the customers' booking.
	
	\item \textbf{Maps Service}: provides the interface to the \textit{CLup Server} to deal with the maps data. It is required to retrieve the best possible path between two positions and to calculate the \textit{leave-at-time}.\newline
	The service is Google Distance Matrix API and provides travel distance and time for a matrix of origins and destinations, based on the recommended route between start and end points.
\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{AuthManager}: deals with the authentication of CLup admins, store managers and employees. Allows the generation of store credentials. Further detailed in \clupautoref{fig:cmp_auth}.
	
	\item \textbf{DashboardManager}: handles the main features offered through the WebApp. In particular, it offers a dashboard that allows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Store managers}:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item to monitor the status of their store;
					\item to change the maximum number of people inside the store;
					\item to manage the bookings of the customers.
				\end{itemize}
			
		\item \textbf{Store employees}: to view the next store passes that will be called.
		\item \textbf{CLup admins}: to manage the creation and deletion of stores. It interfaces with the MailManager to send the credentials to the store PEC address.
		\item \textbf{Customers}: to confirm and delete their bookings via link.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Model}: high-level component which represent the data on the server and acts as a mask to the database server. Since it is the entry point to the data, almost every component needs to interface with this one.
	
	\item \textbf{EntityManager}: deals with all the management of the data needed by the system. It perform object-relational mapping to the \textbf{Model} component and uses the methods provided by the \textbf{DBMS API} to execute queries on the database.

The components in \clupautoref{fig:cmp_auth} are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{LoginManager}: handles the login and credentials check of CLup admins, store managers and store employees in the system. It interfaces with the RoleManager through the \textbf{RoleInterface} to give the right permissions to the logged user.
	
	\item \textbf{RoleManager}: handles the role based access control (RBAC): an authorization scheme that grants access rights based on the role of the use. In particular, this components grants user authentication and authorization:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Authentication: request and verify the identity of CLup admin, store managers and employees attempting to login using a usercode and password;
		\item Authorization: verify the permissions of the logged user to perform any requested action (e.g. adding or removing a store, creating a new item category, etc.) before performing it.
	\end{itemize}
		
	\item \textbf{CredentialsGenerator}: handles the credentials generation through the \textbf{AuthCredentialsInterface} when a CLup Admin adds a new store to the system. In the event that the CLup admin request new credentials for stores, this component will generate new ones.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{QRCheckManager}: it handles the scanning and validation process of QR codes. The scanned code validity will be checked versus the one stored in the Model via the ModelInterface.
\end{itemize}
\clearpage

\section{Deployment view}\label{sec:deployment_view}
The system presents a \textbf{three-tier architecture} as shown in \clupautoref{fig:depl_diag}. This is a well-established software application architecture that organizes applications into three logical and physical computing tiers. The chief benefit of three-tier architecture is that because each tier runs on its own infrastructure, each tier can be developed simultaneously by separate developers and can be updated or scaled as needed without impacting the other tiers.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Tier 1: presentation tier}. It is the front end layer in the three-tier system and consists of the user interface. It communicates with others layers via API calls on the HTTPS protocol.\newline
	The Customer App is installed on compatible Android or iOS phones. Distribution of the appropriate executable will be handled by the corresponding app stores. For the Local Ticketing Kiosk, a custom non-public executable will be installed on an Android tablet.\newline
	The Store App is installed on Android or iOS phones and will not be publicly available.\newline
	Finally, the Web App will be accessible through web browser by connecting to a dedicated website.
	
	\item \textbf{Tier 2: business logic tier}. It contains the functional business logic which drives the application’s core capabilities. Multiple client components can access the this tier simultaneously, so this layer must manage its own transactions.\newline
	The CLup Server App is installed on a dedicated server with a running instance of Apache TomEE 8.
	
	\item \textbf{Tier 3: data management tier}. It comprises of the database/data storage system and data access layer. Data is stored in a persistent way into a MySQL database and accessed by the business logic tier via API calls.
\end{itemize}

\section{Runtime view}
This section describes the most important components interactions of the system.\newline
For the sake of simplicity the sequence diagrams are based on the first level of components. 
\subsection{Customer App token}
At the startup, the Customer App will try to request a token to the server via the token manager. Having a token is mandatory in order to take any action with the app.\newline
This process is really important because the token is the only way to identify a customer since no registration is expected. The app will reiterate the process till a valid token is gotten.\newline
This is an automatic process and no action is performed by the user during the operation.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{sequence/seq_token}
	\caption{Customer app token request.}
	\label{fig:seq_token}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

\subsection{Ticket request}
The request for a ticket starts from the Customer App and contains both token and selected store. The token validation is the first operation performed by the server and consequently, if all the checks go well, a ticket is retrieved.
\vspace{0.1cm}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sequence/seq_ticket}
	\caption{Ticket request.}
	\label{fig:seq_ticket}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

\subsection{Booking request}
A user can book a visit for a store if he hasn't booked a visit to the same store and in the same day yet. This check is done together with the token validation and others checks.\newline
Since a booking must be confirmed via a link, an email is sent at the end of the whole process through the mail server.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[angle=90,origin=c,height=\linewidth]{sequence/seq_booking}
	\caption{Booking request.}
	\label{fig:seq_booking}
\end{figure}

\clearpage
\subsection{Leave At Time}
The Customer App reminds the user to leave the place where he is in order to ensure that he arrives on time.\newline
The server fetches all the valid store passes of the day and computes the distance of the customer from the respective store. If the customer should leave the place where he is, a notification is sent to him. For the sake of simplicity the token validation process is omitted.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{sequence/seq_leave}
	\caption{Leave at time function.}
	\label{fig:seq_leave}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Web App login}
The following sequence diagram represents the login process to the Web App. CLup admins, store managers and store employees will authenticate to the system by submitting their credentials via a form.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{sequence/seq_login}
	\caption{Web App login.}
	\label{fig:seq_login}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

\subsection{Check store status}
After logging in, the store managers can see the store status, for instance the visits booked. The following sequence diagram represents this process. 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{sequence/seq_check_status}
	\caption{Check store status.}
	\label{fig:seq_check_status}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Store App login}
As the Customer App, the Store App also has a token to operate. This time there is a login process before the generation of the token.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{sequence/seq_app_login}
	\caption{Store app login.}
	\label{fig:seq_app_login}
\end{figure}

\subsection{QR Code scan}
The scan of the QR is the most important part of the Store App. After the token validation, the QR code is validated as the sequence diagram shows. If the pass is valid, his status is updated.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{sequence/seq_scan_pass}
	\caption{Store app scan process.}
	\label{fig:seq_scan_pass}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Store registration}
The store registration is performed by a CLup admin via the Web App after his login. Prompted information are checked from the system and then, if the store doesn't already exist, the store is saved into the database. After that, the credentials for the store managers and store employees are generated and sent to the store PEC address.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{sequence/seq_store_registration}

\section{Selected architectural styles and patterns}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Three-tiers architecture}: as stated in \clupautoref{sec:deployment_view}, the CLup system adopt this well-established software application architecture.
	
	\item \textbf{Client-Server architecture}: in this architecture, clients and servers are separate logical objects that communicate over a network to perform tasks together. A client makes a request for a service and receives a reply to that request; a server receives and processes a request, and sends back the required response.
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{client_server_diag}
		\caption{Client-Server architecture.}
		\label{fig:client_server_diag}
	\end{figure}
	
	\item \textbf{REST API}: Representational State Transfer (REST) is a set of commands commonly used with web transactions. It allows the usage of HTTP to obtain data and generate operations on those data in all possible formats, such as XML and JSON.
	
	\item \textbf{Model-View-Controller}: software design pattern that divides the program logic into three interconnected elements.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Model: central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.
		\item View: any visual representation of  such as a chart, diagram or table.
		\item Controller: responds to the user input and performs interactions on the data model objects. The controller receives the input, optionally validates it and then passes the input to the model.
	\end{itemize}

\section{Other design decisions}
\subsection{Database Structure}
As already mentioned all the data will be stored in a database. The chosen DBMS is MySQL since it is an \textbf{open-source relational database management system} (\textbf{RDBMS}).\newline
The following diagram explains how the database is structured.
